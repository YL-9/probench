# Easy Problem

## Problem Description

Cube is given an integer $ n $ . She wants to know how many ordered pairs of positive integers $ (a,b) $ there are such that $ a=n-b $ . Since Cube is not very good at math, please help her!

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 99 $ ) â€” the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \leq n \leq 100 $ ).

## Output Format

For each test case, output the number of ordered pairs $ (a, b) $ on a new line.

## Sample #1

### Sample Input #1

```
3
2
4
6
```

### Sample Output #1

```
1
3
5
```

## Hint

In the first test case, the only ordered pair that works is $ (a,b)=(1,1) $ .

In the second test case, the three ordered pairs of $ (a,b) $ that work are $ (3,1), (2,2), (1,3) $ .
