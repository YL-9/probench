# Paint a Strip

## Problem Description

You have an array of zeros $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ of length $ n $ .

You can perform two types of operations on it:

1. Choose an index $ i $ such that $ 1 \le i \le n $ and $ a_i = 0 $ , and assign $ 1 $ to $ a_i $ ;
2. Choose a pair of indices $ l $ and $ r $ such that $ 1 \le l \le r \le n $ , $ a_l = 1 $ , $ a_r = 1 $ , $ a_l + \ldots + a_r \ge \lceil\frac{r - l + 1}{2}\rceil $ , and assign $ 1 $ to $ a_i $ for all $ l \le i \le r $ .

What is the minimum number of operations of the first type needed to make all elements of the array equal to one?

## Input Format

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^4 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the length of the array.

Note that there is no limit on the sum of $ n $ over all test cases.

## Output Format

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of needed operations of first type.

## Hint

In the first test case, you can perform an operation of the $ 1 $ st type with $ i = 1 $ .

In the second test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations:

1. Operation of $ 1 $ st type, $ i = 1 $ . After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $ [1, 0] $ .
2. Operation of $ 1 $ st type, $ i = 2 $ . After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $ [1, 1] $ .

1. Operation of $ 1 $ st type, $ i = 1 $ . After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $ [1, 0, 0, 0] $ .
2. Operation of $ 1 $ st type, $ i = 4 $ . After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $ [1, 0, 0, 1] $ .
3. Operation of $ 2 $ nd type, $ l = 1 $ , $ r = 4 $ . On this segment, $ a_l + \ldots + a_r = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2 $ , which is not less than $ \lceil\frac{r - l + 1}{2}\rceil = 2 $ . After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $ [1, 1, 1, 1] $ .
