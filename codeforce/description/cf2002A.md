# Distanced Coloring

## Problem Description

You received an $ n\times m $ grid from a mysterious source. The source also gave you a magic positive integer constant $ k $ .

The source told you to color the grid with some colors, satisfying the following condition:

- If $ (x_1,y_1) $ , $ (x_2,y_2) $ are two distinct cells with the same color, then $ \max(|x_1-x_2|,|y_1-y_2|)\ge k $ .

You don't like using too many colors. Please find the minimum number of colors needed to color the grid.

## Input Format

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1\le t\le1000 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case consists of three positive integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ ( $ 1\le n,m,k\le10^4 $ ) — the dimensions of the grid and the magic constant.

## Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of colors needed to color the grid.

5 1 10000
7 3 4
3 2 7
8 9 6
2 5 4
```

### Sample Output #1

```

## Hint

In the first test case, one of the optimal constructions is:
