# Grid Game 3-angle

## Problem Description

Your friends, Anda and Kamu decide to play a game called Grid Game and ask you to become the gamemaster. As the gamemaster, you set up a triangular grid of size $ N $ . The grid has $ N $ rows (numbered from $ 1 $ to $ N $ ). Row $ r $ has $ r $ cells; the $ c $ -th cell of row $ r $ is denoted as $ (r, c) $ .

You then give Anda and Kamu an integer $ K $ and commence the game.

Anda and Kamu will take turns alternately with Anda taking the first turn. A player on their turn will do the following.

- Choose a cell $ (r, c) $ with at least one stone on it.
- Remove at least one but at most $ K $  stones from the chosen cell.
- For each cell $ (x, y) $ such that $ r + 1 \leq x \leq \min(N, r + K) $ and $ c \leq y \leq c + x - r $ , add zero or more stones but at most $ K $  stones to cell $ (x, y) $ .

The following illustrations show all the possible cells in which you can add stones for $ K = 3 $ . You choose the cell $ (2, 1) $ for the left illustration and the cell $ (4, 3) $ for the right illustration.

Determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

## Input Format

This problem is a multi-case problem. The first line consists of an integer $ T $ ( $ 1 \leq T \leq 100 $ ) that represents the number of test cases.

Each test case starts with a single line consisting of three integers $ N $ $ M $ $ K $ ( $ 1 \leq N \leq 10^9; 1 \leq M, K \leq 200\,000 $ ). Then, each of the next $ M $ lines consists of three integers $ R_i $ $ C_i $ $ A_i $ ( $ 1 \leq C_i \leq R_i \leq N; 1 \leq A_1 \leq 10^9 $ ). The pairs $ (R_i, C_i) $ are distinct.

The sum of $ M $ across all test cases does not exceed $ 200\,000 $ .

## Output Format

For each case, output a string in a single line representing the player who will win the game if both players play optimally. Output Anda if Anda, the first player, wins. Otherwise, output Kamu.

## Hint

Explanation for the sample input/output #1

For the first case, during the first turn, Anda will remove all the stones from cell $ (1, 1) $ and then add three stones at $ (2, 1) $ . The only cell with stones left is now cell $ (2, 1) $ with five stones, so Kamu must remove stones from that cell. No matter how many stones are removed by Kamu, Anda can remove all the remaining stones at $ (2, 1) $ and win the game.

For the second case, Kamu can always mirror whatever move made by Anda until Anda can no longer complete their turn.
