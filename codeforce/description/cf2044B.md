# Normal Problem

## Problem Description

A string consisting of only characters 'p', 'q', and 'w' is painted on a glass window of a store. Ship walks past the store, standing directly in front of the glass window, and observes string $ a $ . Ship then heads inside the store, looks directly at the same glass window, and observes string $ b $ .

Ship gives you string $ a $ . Your job is to find and output $ b $ .

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 100 $ ) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string $ a $ ( $ 1 \leq |a| \leq 100 $ ) — the string Ship observes from outside the store. It is guaranteed that $ a $ only contains characters 'p', 'q', and 'w'.

## Output Format

For each test case, output string $ b $ , the string Ship observes from inside the store, on a new line.
