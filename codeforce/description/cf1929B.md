# Sasha and the Drawing

## Problem Description

Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size $ n \times n $ , in which some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least $ k $ diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size $ n \times n $ has a total of $ 4n - 2 $ diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the minimum number of cells he needs to color.

## Input Format

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 1000 $ ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2 \leq n \leq 10^8 $ , $ 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 $ ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

## Output Format

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

## Hint

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color $ 2 $ cells so that $ 4 $ diagonals contain at least one colored cell:
