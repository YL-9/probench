# Non Prime Tree

## Problem Description

You are given a tree with $ n $ vertices.

You need to construct an array $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ of length $ n $ , consisting of unique integers from $ 1 $ to $ 2 \cdot n $ , and such that for each edge $ u_i \leftrightarrow v_i $ of the tree, the value $ |a_{u_i} - a_{v_i}| $ is not a prime number.

Find any array that satisfies these conditions, or report that there is no such array.

## Input Format

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^4 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

The next $ n - 1 $ lines contain the edges of the tree, one edge per line. The $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \le u_i, v_i \le n $ ; $ u_i \neq v_i $ ), denoting the edge between the nodes $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ .

It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 $ .

## Output Format

For each test case, if an array that satisfies the conditions exists, print its elements $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ . Otherwise, print $ -1 $ .

## Hint

The possible answers are shown below. Instead of the vertex numbers, the corresponding elements of the array $ a $ are written in them.
