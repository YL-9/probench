# Grid Walk

## Problem Description

You have an $ n \times n $ grid and two integers $ a $ and $ b $ . Both the rows and the columns are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Let's denote the cell at the intersection of the $ i $ -th row and the $ j $ -th column as $ (i, j) $ .

You are standing in the cell $ (1, 1) $ and want to move into the cell $ (n, n) $ .

Suppose you are in the cell $ (i, j) $ ; in one step, you can move either into the cell $ (i, j + 1) $ or into the cell $ (i + 1, j) $ if the corresponding cells exist.

Let's define the cost of the cell $ (i, j) $ as $ c(i, j) = \gcd(i, a) + \gcd(j, b) $ (here, $ \gcd(x,y) $ denotes the greatest common divisor of $ x $ and $ y $ ). The cost of the route from $ (1, 1) $ to $ (n, n) $ is the sum of costs of the visited cells (including the starting cell and the finishing cell).

## Input Format

The only line contains three integers $ n $ , $ a $ , and $ b $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 10^6 $ ; $ 1 \le a, b \le 10^6 $ ).

## Output Format

Print one integer â€” the cost of the cheapest route from $ (1, 1) $ to $ (n, n) $ .
