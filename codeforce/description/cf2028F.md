# Alice's Adventures in Addition

## Problem Description

Note that the memory limit is unusual.

The Cheshire Cat has a riddle for Alice: given $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ and a target $ m $ , is there a way to insert $ + $ and $ \times $ into the circles of the expression $ $$$a_1 \circ a_2 \circ \cdots \circ a_n = m $ $  to make it true? We follow the usual order of operations:  $ \\times $  is done before  $ +$$$.

Although Alice is excellent at chess, she is not good at math. Please help her so she can find a way out of Wonderland!

## Input Format

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^4 $ ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $ n, m $ ( $ 1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 $ ; $ 1\le m\le 10^4 $ ) — the number of integers and the target, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0\le a_i\le 10^4 $ ) — the elements of the array $ a $ .

The sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2\cdot 10^5 $ .

## Output Format

For each test case, output "YES" without quotes if it is possible to get the target by inserting $ + $ or $ \times $ and "NO" otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

## Sample #1

### Sample Input #1

```
6
5 4
2 1 1 1 2
5 5
2 1 1 1 2
5 6
2 1 1 1 2
5 7
2 1 1 1 2
5 8
2 1 1 1 2
5 6
2 0 2 2 3
```

### Sample Output #1

```
YES
YES
YES
YES
NO
YES
```

## Hint

Possible solutions for the first four test cases are shown below. $ $$$\begin{align*} 2 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 \times 2 &= 4 \\ 2 \times 1 + 1 + 1 \times 2 &= 5 \\ 2 \times 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 &= 6 \\ 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 &= 7 \\ \end{align*} $ $  It is impossible to get a result of  $ 8$$$ in the fifth test case.
