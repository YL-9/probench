# Fixing the Expression

## Problem Description

An expression is a string consisting of three characters, where the first and the last characters are digits (from $ 0 $ to $ 9 $ ), and the middle character is a comparison symbol (&lt;, = or &gt;).

An expression is true if the comparison symbol matches the digits (for example, if the first digit is strictly less than the last digit, the comparison symbol should be &lt;).

For example, the expressions 1&lt;3, 4&gt;2, 0=0 are true, while 5&gt;5, 7&lt;3 are not.

You are given a string $ s $ , which is an expression. Change as few characters as possible so that $ s $ becomes a true expression. Note that if $ s $ is already true, you should leave it as it is.

## Input Format

The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 300 $ ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing the string $ s $ ( $ |s| = 3 $ , the first and the last characters of $ s $ are digits, the second character is a comparison symbol).

## Output Format

For each test case, print a string consisting of $ 3 $ characters — a true expression which can be obtained by changing as few characters as possible in $ s $ . If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
