# Grove

## Problem Description

You want to plant trees in a square lawn of size $ n \times n $ whose corners have Cartesian coordinates $ (0, 0) $ , $ (n, 0) $ , $ (0, n) $ , and $ (n, n) $ . Trees can only be planted at locations with integer coordinates. Every tree will grow roots within a disk of radius $ r $ centered at the location where the tree was planted; such disks must be fully contained in the lawn (possibly touching the boundary of the lawn) and can only intersect each other on their boundaries.

Find a configuration that maximizes the number of trees.

## Input Format

The first and only line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 20 $ ) and a real number $ r $ ( $ 0 < r \leq n/2 $ ) — the length of the sides of the lawn, and the radius of the disks where each tree will grow roots. The real number $ r $ is given in decimal notation with at least $ 1 $ and at most $ 3 $ digits after the decimal point.

## Output Format

In the first line, print the maximum number $ m $ of trees that can be planted.

In the next $ m $ lines, print a configuration that maximizes the number of trees. Specifically, in the $ (i+1) $ -th line, print two integers $ x $ and $ y $ — the coordinates of the location where the $ i $ -th tree should be planted. You can print the trees in any order.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

## Hint

For the first sample, the sample output is shown in the following figure. Note that this is not the only configuration that maximizes the number of trees.
