# Help, what does it mean to be "Based"

## Problem Description

## Input Format

Sup, gimme a single integer $ x $ ( $ 1 \le x \le 4 $ ) homie uwu :3

## Output Format

If $ x = 1 $ , spit out some based code that, like when ya feed it two integers $ a $ and $ b $ , it hands over their sum.

If $ x = 2 $ , slap some based code that takes an integer $ a $ and returns its absolute value like magic, no cap.

If $ x = 3 $ , check this out: blaze some based code that grabs an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 50 $ ) and an array $ a $ of $ n $ distinct integers, then flexes the maximum value real quick.

If $ x = 4 $ , toss me some based code that snatches an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 50 $ ), an array $ a $ of $ n $ distinct integers and an integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \le k \le n $ ), then nails down that $ k $ -th largest value in the array. Get it, fam!
