# Creating Words

## Problem Description

Matthew is given two strings $ a $ and $ b $ , both of length $ 3 $ . He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of $ a $ with the first character of $ b $ . He wants you to output $ a $ and $ b $ after the swap.

Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.

## Input Format

The first line contains $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 100 $ ) â€” the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, $ a $ and $ b $ , both of length $ 3 $ . The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.

## Output Format

For each test case, after the swap, output $ a $ and $ b $ , separated by a space.
