# Vlad and Avoiding X

## Problem Description

Vladislav has a grid of size $ 7 \times 7 $ , where each cell is colored black or white. In one operation, he can choose any cell and change its color (black $ \leftrightarrow $ white).

Find the minimum number of operations required to ensure that there are no black cells with four diagonal neighbors also being black.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 200 $ ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of $ 7 $ lines, each containing $ 7 $ characters. Each of these characters is either $ \texttt{W} $ or $ \texttt{B} $ , denoting a white or black cell, respectively.

## Output Format

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to ensure that there are no black cells with all four diagonal neighbors also being black.

## Hint

The first test case is illustrated in the statement.

The second test case is illustrated below:
