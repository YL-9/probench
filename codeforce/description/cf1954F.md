# Unique Strings

## Problem Description

Let's say that two strings $ a $ and $ b $ are equal if you can get the string $ b $ by cyclically shifting string $ a $ . For example, the strings 0100110 and 1100100 are equal, while 1010 and 1100 are not.

You are given a binary string $ s $ of length $ n $ . Its first $ c $ characters are 1-s, and its last $ n - c $ characters are 0-s.

In one operation, you can replace one 0 with 1.

Calculate the number of unique strings you can get using no more than $ k $ operations. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .

## Input Format

The first and only line contains three integers $ n $ , $ c $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 3000 $ ; $ 1 \le c \le n $ ; $ 0 \le k \le n - c $ ) — the length of string $ s $ , the length of prefix of 1-s and the maximum number of operations.

## Output Format

Print the single integer — the number of unique strings you can achieve performing no more than $ k $ operations, modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .

## Hint

In the first test case, the only possible string is 1.

In the second test case, the possible strings are: 100, 110, and 111. String 101 is equal to 110, so we don't count it.

In the third test case, the possible strings are: 10000, 11000, 10100. String 10010 is equal to 10100, and 10001 is equal to 11000.
